# The Sparks foundation- Data science and Machine-Learning
#TASK  2
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of
marks that a student is expected to score based upon the
number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear
regression task as it involves just two variables.

Task 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
You are the business owner of the retail firm and want to see how your company is performing. You are interested in finding out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. What all business problems you can derive by looking into the data? You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel).
